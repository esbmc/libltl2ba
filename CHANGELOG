* - Parse U, V and -> as right-associative operators and forbid chaining <->
    because there is no universally agreed upon interpretation of a <-> b <-> c.
  - Parser checks that the entire formula was parsed (it silently allowed
    'a X b' before, interpreting just 'a').

  - Various fixes in printing alternating, generalized and Büchi automata
  - Parsing input formulas with the following precedence order for binary
    operators (high to low): U and V, &&, ||, <->, -> (all are still
    left-associative, which may^W must change in the future)
  - Additional debugging information (-d) is output to stderr
  - Many non-semantic changes to the internal API in order for libltl2ba to
    become usable as a library, too; this includes defining and exporting the
    data structures corresponding to the 3 representations of automata used
    internally as well as removing global state and renaming/moving some
    functions
  - Provide a symlink ltl2c to the ltl2ba binary, which defaults to the 'c'
    output mode from LTL2C

  Thanks to Jerry James for the patches addressing the following issues
  - compatibility with gcc 10 (link-time failure for identically named variables
    in different files)
  - Remove unused function and variable declarations
  - Make (f)printf format declarations match the types of the corresponding
    expressions
  - Remove the second argument to Fatal(), fatal() and non_fatal(), since it is
    always NULL
  - Make main() return something (since it is supposed to return int)

  - Two additional output formats besides spin selected by option -O:
    c  : an interpretation of the Büchi automaton in terms of a C program using
         ESBMC intrinsics
    dot: the format understood by the dot family of tools for drawing the Büchi
         automaton as a graph (the default sink state is omitted here for
         brevity)

  - fixing a bug in the way sets were used for strongly connected components.
    Thanks to Joachim Klein (klein@tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de) who found the bug and
    proposed a patch to fix it.
  - fixing a bug in the simplification with strongly connected components for
    the generalized Büchi automaton.
  - improving the simplification with strongly connected components for the
    generalized Büchi automaton.
  - using getrusage to compute running times for the statistics
  - some other minor updates.
