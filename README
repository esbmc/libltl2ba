1. ABOUT

The libltl2ba software is a modification of LTL2BA and incorporates the changes
from LTL2C. It aims at making the functionality of both available in form of a
library while maintaining compatibility with the original algorithms.

LTL2C has been written by Jeremy Morse.  It is based on LTL2BA version 1.1 and
adds output formats for dot and the ESBMC model checker.

LTL2BA has originally been written by Denis Oddoux and was modified by Paul
Gastin.  It is based on the translation algorithm presented at CAV '01:
	P.Gastin and D.Oddoux
	"Fast LTL to Büchi Automata Translation"
	in 13th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification, CAV 2001,
	G. Berry, H. Comon, A. Finkel (Eds.)
	Paris, France, July 18-22, 2001,
	Proceedings - LNCS 2102, pp. 53-65

Part of the code included is issued from the SPIN software Version 3.4.1
The SPIN software is written by Gerard J. Holzmann, originally as part
of ``Design and Validation of Protocols,'' ISBN 0-13-539925-4,
1991, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
Here are the files that contain some code from Spin v3.4.1 :

	cache.c  (originally tl_cache.c)
	lex.c    (           tl_lex.c  )
	ltl2ba.h (           tl.h      )
	main.c   (           tl_main.c )
	mem.c.   (           tl_mem.c  )
	parse.c  (           tl_parse.c)
	rewrt.c  (           tl_rewrt.c)

2. COMPILING

unpack the archive:
> tar -xzf libltl2ba-2.0.tar.gz
> cd libltl2ba-2.0

compile the program
> make

3. EXECUTING

run the program
> ./ltl2ba -f 'formula'

The formula is an LTL formula, and may contain propositional symbols,
boolean operators, temporal operators, and parentheses.  The syntax is a
backwards-compatible extension of the one used in the 'Spin' model-checker.

Propositonal Symbols:
        true, false
        any lowercase string
        {C expression}

Boolean operators:
        !, NOT  (negation)
        ->      (implication)
        <->     (equivalence)
        &&, /\  (and)
        ||, \/  (or)

Temporal operators:
        G, []   (always)
        F, <>   (eventually)
        U       (until)
        V       (release)
        X       (next)

Use spaces between any symbols. Unary operators bind stronger that binary ones.
Precedence (high to low) and associativity of binary operators is as follows:

        U, V  : right
        &&    : left
        ||    : left
        <->   : none
        ->    : right

The result is a 'never' claim in Promela that can be given to the Spin model
checker to verify properties on a system.
