The LTL2BA software is written by Denis Oddoux, the algorithm it uses
was published in :
	G. Berry, H. Comon, A. Finkel (Eds.):
	Computer Aided Verification
	13th International Conference, CAV 2001, 
	Paris, France, July 18-22, 2001, Proceedings - LNCS 2102
	"Fast LTL to Büchi Automata Translation", 
	P.Gastin and D.Oddoux, pp. 53-65

Part of the code included is issued from the SPIN software Version 3.4.1
The SPIN software is written by Gerard J. Holzmann, originally as part
of ``Design and Validation of Protocols,'' ISBN 0-13-539925-4,
1991, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
Here are the files that contain some code from Spin v3.4.1 :

	cache.c  (originally tl_cache.c)
	lex.c    (           tl_lex.c  )
	ltl2ba.h (	     tl.h      )
	main.c   (	     tl_main.c )
	mem.c	 (	     tl_mem.c  )
	parse.c  (	     tl_parse.c)
	rewrt.c  (	     tl_rewrt.c)
	trans.c	 (	     tl_trans.c)

2. COMPILING

open the archive :
> gunzip ltl2ba.tar.gz
> tar xf ltl2ba.tar
> cd ltl2ba

compile the program
> make

3. EXECUTING

run the program
> ./ltl2ba -f "formula"

The formula is an LTL formula, and may contain propositional symbols, 
boolean operators, temporal operators, and parentheses.
The syntax used is the one used in the 'Spin' model-checker

Propositonal Symbols:
        true, false
	any lowercase string

Boolean operators:
        !   (negation)
        ->  (implication)
	<-> (equivalence)
        &&  (and)
        ||  (or)

Temporal operators:
        []  (always)
        <>  (eventually)
        U   (until)
        V   (release)
        X   (next)

Use spaces between any symbols.

The result is a never claim in Promela that can be given to the
Spin model checker to verify properties on a system.

run the command
> ./ltl2ba
